/**
 * Single source of truth for the two loan-direction arrows so every spot (the
 * add form tabs, the list metrics, the filter tabs and the row badge) renders
 * the same glyph and color — change it here and it updates everywhere.
 *
 * - `lent` ("Owed to me")  → down-left arrow, `success` (green)
 * - `borrowed` ("I owe")   → up-right arrow, `destructive` (red)
 *
 * Colors use the `success`/`destructive` theme tokens, which already resolve
 * per light/dark mode. Pass `colored={false}` where the surrounding element
 * already sets the color (a `MetricCard` accent, a `StatusBadge` variant) so the
 * icon inherits `currentColor` instead of fighting it.
